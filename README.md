# STUDENT-SECURE

This project is a web application built using React and Firebase, designed to facilitate communication between teachers and students. The platform allows students to log in using Google Sign-In and view the posts shared by their teachers. Teachers have the ability to create posts, announcements, homework assignments, and even share e-books with their students hiding the source url of the document. One unique feature of the platform is that teachers can embed Google Docs or online documents into their posts. This ensures that students can access the content without seeing the source link, promoting privacy and preventing unauthorized sharing.
